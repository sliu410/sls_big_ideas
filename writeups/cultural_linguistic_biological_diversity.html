                     <h4>How would you define this big idea?</h4>
                     <p>Social justice on campus requires working toward inclusive excellence in all aspects of university. The faculty and staff members who coordinate Institute Diversity initiatives collaboratively aim to enhance student understanding of social justice through involvement in community service focusing on sustainability and civic engagement. Student initiatives in Institute Diversity include the OMED Challenge and Edge peer mentoring programs, various initiatives in the Office of Hispanic Initiatives, and the Women, Science, and Technology Learning Community. By encouraging students in diversity and inclusion programs to participate in community service and civic engagement, Institute Diversity student programs seek to increase understanding of social sustainability, defined by the <i>Business Dictionary</i> as “The ability of a community to develop processes and structures which not only meet the needs of its current members but also support the ability of future generations to maintain a healthy community.”</p>

                     <h4>How is this big idea included in your work?</h4>
                     <p>Students in Institute Diversity programs such as OMED Challenge and Edge peer-mentoring programs, various initiatives in the Office of Hispanic Initiatives, and the Women, Science, and Technology Learning Community will volunteer to participate in common community service projects.</p>

                     <p>Students in Institute Diversity programs might also or instead volunteer as contributors to faculty projects that link sustainability, service, and social justice.</p>

                     <p>Students in Institute Diversity programs will also be encouraged to take courses related to sustainability and/or social justice.</p>

                      <p>
                    Inclusive excellence is a strategic framework, encouraging active examination and evaluation of Tech’s practices and policies. This tactical assessment will allow the Institution to set goals with measurable outcomes. Our success is dependent on how well we value, engage and include the rich diversity of students, staff, faculty, administrators, and alumni constituents, and all the valuable social dimensions that they bring to the campus. More than a short-term project or single office initiative, inclusive excellence is a comprehensive approach that requires a fundamental transformation of the institution by embedding and practicing inclusive excellence in every effort, aspect, and level of our Institution. The goal is to make inclusive excellence a habit that is implemented and practiced consistently. To practice inclusiveness is excellence.

                     <h4>How would you define this big idea?</h4>
                     <p>There is a growing transdisciplinary field that investigates the links between the world’s cultural, linguistic, and biological diversity.  By rejecting the separation between nature and culture, this field of study examines the various threats on diversity for both humanity and the earth.  Whether preserving cultures, languages, or plant and animal species, experts in this area are concerned with what is under threat of extinction or assimilation as well as with what can be learned as a result of the preservation or conservation of diversity. The impetus for the emergence of this field came from the observation that all three diversities are under threat by some of the same forces and from the perception that loss of diversity at all levels spells dramatic consequences for the planet.</p>

                     <h4>How is this big idea included in your work?</h4>
                     <p>I am planning a course related to “sustaining cultural and linguistic diversity” in Spain for my “Serve-Learn-Sustain in Spain” semester abroad program.  The course, “Sustainability in Spain,” is currently taught in the Spain LBAT (Language for Business and Technology) Program, but will have an added component on “social sustainability” in the semester-abroad program to begin in spring 2018.  We will examine national vs. regional identities in Spain and the role that different cultural and linguistic sub-groups play. I also teach several on-campus courses related to “service-Learning,” “community outreach,” and “community internship,” in which students examines issues of cultural and linguistic diversity in the local Latino community.  Concepts such as assimilation and preservation—of culture, of language, of knowledge—are central themes of these courses. I also teach the senior capstone course, “Intercultural Seminar,” which teaches students to properly engage in cross-cultural comparison and to understand different cultural dimensions.  We specifically examine issues of cultural, linguistic, and biological diversity in case studies from Mexico and Peru.</p>

                      <p>
                      Over the past decade, the field of biocultural diversity has arisen as an area of transdisciplinary research concerned with investigating the links between the world's linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity as manifestations of the diversity of life. The impetus for the emergence of this field came from the observation that all three diversities are under threat by some of the same forces and from the perception that loss of diversity at all levels spells dramatic consequences for humanity and the earth. Accordingly, the field of biocultural diversity has developed with both a theoretical and a practical side, the latter focusing on on-the-ground work and policy, as well as with an ethics and human rights component. This review provides some background on the historical antecedents and beginnings of this field and on its philosophical and ethical underpinnings, and then surveys the key literature on biocultural diversity, concentrating on three main aspects: global and regional studies on the links between linguistic, cultural, and biological diversity; the measurement and assessment of biocultural diversity; and the protection and maintenance of biocultural diversity. The review concludes with some considerations about future prospects for this emerging field.

                      </p>

                      <p>
                      There is an emerging recognition that the diversity of life comprises both biological and cultural diversity. In the past, however, it has been common to make divisions between nature and culture, arising partly out of a desire to control nature. The range of interconnections between biological and cultural diversity are reflected in the growing variety of environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged. In this article, we present ideas from a number of these sub-disciplines. We investigate four bridges linking both types of diversity (beliefs and worldviews, livelihoods and practices, knowledge bases and languages, and norms and institutions), seek to determine the common drivers of loss that exist, and suggest a novel and integrative path forwards. We recommend that future policy responses should target both biological and cultural diversity in a combined approach to conservation. The degree to which biological diversity is linked to cultural diversity is only beginning to be understood. But it is precisely as our knowledge is advancing that these complex systems are under threat. While conserving nature alongside human cultures presents unique challenges, we suggest that any hope for saving biological diversity is predicated on a concomitant effort to appreciate and protect cultural diversity.</p>

                     <h4>How would you define this big idea?</h4>
                     <p>Sustainability provides a set of analytical and normative frameworks to understand and overcome the challenges of the 21st Century, such as extreme poverty, climate change, and social inequality. Although sustainability is a driving force behind many global agendas for the future, each society adopts and interprets sustainability according to its different cultural and linguistic resources. Georgia Tech’s faculty and students should be aware of the cultural and linguistic challenges that emerge from the different meanings and interpretations of sustainability in diverse contexts. As long as we continue to take its meanings for granted, we will always fail to understand how sustainability works in the real world. To overcome this problem, it is important to examine sustainability across languages and cultures.</p>

                     <h4>How is this big idea included in your work?</h4>
                     <p>The study of documentaries and other media productions focusing on urban challenges in Latin America has helped me understand how different societies adopt, implement, reframe or defy sustainability while using specific conventions and protocols that refer to particular expectations, legacies, habits, and aspirations.</p>

                     <h4>How would you define this big idea?</h4>
                     <p>Species biodiversity is a fundamental aspect of the structure and function of natural communities. It reflects both the number of species in a community and the relative abundance of those species; more species and more equitable abundance of the species increase diversity. Diversity is determined by processes at a variety of scales including: (1) the regional species pool as produced by geological and evolutionary history; the variability of different habitats at the landscape scale; and species interactions at local scales. Of course, human impacts occur at all these scales (unintentional or intentional species introduction; over-exploitation), which frequently has negative effects on biodiversity. Unfortunately biodiversity is known to positively affect a number of important ecosystem properties such as their productivity, capacity to recycle nutrients, and maintain their functioning when challenged with natural and human disturbance. Thus, preserving biodiversity is therefore not simply a matter of conserving warm, fuzzy or charismatic creatures.</p>

                     <h4>How is this big idea included in your work?</h4>
                     <p>I would like to create biodiversity modules for relevant classes or participate in teaching where this perspective is warranted. I could also help with SLS projects designed to measure biodiversity as part of their analysis of the community. </p>
